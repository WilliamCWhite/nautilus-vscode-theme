# Nautilus Theme
A VSCode theme based on the GMK Nautilus Keycaps

## Installation
The extension isn't currently published to the VSCode extension marketplace, so you need to install it manually.
Download the nautilus-0.1.vsix file and simply copy it into your /.vscode/extensions folder (on Windows, .vscode is usually found in your User folder).

## Creation
I used [Theme Studio for VSCode](https://themes.vscode.one/) to make this theme. If you want to edit it, I recommend using Theme Studio, since its a really robust and easy-to-use tool. You can fork it on Theme Studio [here](https://themes.vscode.one/theme/vaderslayer72/2CekdbmJ) and make whatever changes you want.
