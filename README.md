# Nautilus Theme
A VSCode theme based on the GMK Nautilus Keycaps

## Installation
The extension isn't currently published to the VSCode extension marketplace, so you need to install it manually.
Download the nautilus-0.1.0.vsix file anywhere on your computer. Then, in VSCode, go to the Extensions Tab, click the 3 dot menu at the top, and select "Install from VSIX." Find and select the .vsix file to install the extension.

## Creation
I used [Theme Studio for VSCode](https://themes.vscode.one/) to make this theme. If you want to edit it, I recommend using Theme Studio, since its a really robust and easy-to-use tool. You can fork it on Theme Studio [here](https://themes.vscode.one/theme/vaderslayer72/2CekdbmJ) and make whatever changes you want.
